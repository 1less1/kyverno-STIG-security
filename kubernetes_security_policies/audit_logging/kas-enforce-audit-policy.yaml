# Audit Logging

# V-242403 - "Kubernetes API Server must generate audit records that identify what type of event has occurred, identify the source of the event, 
# contain the event results, identify any users, and identify any containers associated with the event."

# This policy checks if the kube-apiserver pod has the argument 

# Additional Directions:
# The API server policy file allows for the following levels of auditing:
#      None - Do not log events that match the rule.
#      Metadata - Log request metadata (requesting user, timestamp, resource, verb, etc.) but not request or response body.
#      Request - Log event metadata and request body but not response body.
#      RequestResponse - Log event metadata, request, and response bodies.

#Set the value of  "--audit-policy-file" to the path of a file with the following content:
    
#    Log all requests at the RequestResponse level.
#    apiVersion: audit.k8s.io/vX (Where X is the latest apiVersion)
#    kind: Policy
#    rules:
#    - level: RequestResponse


# NOTE: Might need to make a script for this one!!!
